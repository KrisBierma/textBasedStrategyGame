# Treasure Hunt - A Text-based Strategy Game

Treasure Hunt is a text-based game in the spirit of Zork. It takes the player through a vast estate, searching for clues and items to unlock the mystery of the uncle's will and greatest treasure.

It's coded in C++ and diplays all lines to the console. A gif is included to show the game's beginning.
